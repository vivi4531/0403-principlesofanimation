    <dl>
    <dt>Classic example:</dt>
    <dd>No real example, mostly a way of designing animations: drawing every frame, or drawing only keyframes, and filling them in later.</dd>
    <dt>UI example:</dt>
    <dd>Almost always pose to pose, since we define keyframes - starting from the extremes, and going in to more and more details.</dd>
    <dt>Connections:</dt>
    <dd>Almost always connected with arcs and timing, especially slow in and slow out.</dd>
    <dt>Typical CSS</dt>
    <dd><code>@keyframes</code> - lot's of them</dd>
    <dt>Pros</dt>
    <dd>Having lots of keyframes can give very dynamic, very organic looking animations.</dd>
    <dt>Cons</dt>
    <dd>They are a hassle to design ...</dd>
    <dt>Notes</dt>

  <h3>Example:</h3>
  <div id="stage">
    <img src="bouncingball.gif" class="make-background">
    <div id="container">
      <div id="ball" class="squash"></div>
    </div>

  </div>
  <p>Make the beachball follow the path of the blue ball in the gif-animation.<br>
  Don't worry about synchronizing their movement, you can't do that with a gif - but it takes approximately 2.58 seconds to complete.<br>
  Start without any animation, and identify the extremes of the path - the start and the end. Use <code>transform: translate( )</code> with <code>vw</code> as units.
  Keep all the transform-lines, but comment each one out, as you try to find the next one.<br>
  After having found the extremes, find the top and bottom of each 'bounce' along the path.</p>
  <p>When you have enough points, make a @keyframes animation, and put all the transforms at various times - use the x-axis on the path
    as a guide: 0% would be the start, 100% the end, the first bounce around 30-35%.<br>
    Use linear timing-function, and see how close (or not) the animation follows the path.
  </p>
  <p>If you want to improve the animation, you'll have to use different timing on x and y-axis - this will be in part 9. Timing!<br>
  But you can revisit this exercise, and make the container do the x-translation, and make the ball only do the y-translation.<br>
x would still be linear.</p>
